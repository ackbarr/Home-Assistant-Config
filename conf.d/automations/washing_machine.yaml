# the Running state, change the status of the washing machine
# to Running. 
# The status check will ensure we don't try to put the state 
# to Running each time the power level changes, and we're already
# in the Running state.

# Notifications
# Rules
# 1. Don’t send an alert if it is after 10:30pm, or before 7:00am.
# 2. Don’t send an alert unless someone is home. No point alerting us if no one is home to unpack the washing machine.
# 3. If the washing machine is clean, and the time ticks past 8:30am, and people are home, alert them the washing machine is ready.
# 4. Only send an alert to the people who are home. Don’t bother anyone who isn’t at home.
# 5. If the washing machine is clean, and someone arrives home, send everyone who is home an alert, but only if the alert wasn’t sent in the last thirty minutes.
